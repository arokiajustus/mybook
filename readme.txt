Welcome to MyBook Application.

	Need to start Chrome from command prompt with enable file access for running this application.
Because, data-ng-include and data-ng-router is not executed in the local file system.

	So, you can go with the location of the Chrome in the command prompt and run with the following command:-
		chrome --allow-file-access-from-files
